# Ocean Data Challenge :: Air Quality in Catalonia

I used the **SARIMAX** model to predict air pollution in Catalonia.  This model allows the use of external variables called *exogenous variables* (our features) to capture variations that can influence the future prediction of the concentration of the chosen pollutant (NO). The creation of the features (notably thanks to the Global Analysis) and the design of the model are detailed in the report.
